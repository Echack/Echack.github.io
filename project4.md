To-Do List
===============

-   **Class: Object Oriented** 
-   **Grade:93** 
-   **Language(s): C++** 
-   **Source Code Repository:none**

## Project description

It is a to-do list that a user can add tasks and remove tasks from.

## How to run the program

The project can be runned by downloading it into any program that can run c++. In my project I used the "run" button in Apache Netbeans.

## UI Design

The User will type whatever task they want into the bar and when they click the enter button the task will be added to the list. There is also a delete button that will remove the desired task of the user.

Fig 3. and Fig 4. show how the delete button is used to remove tasks in the list and when done everything below the task that was deleted is moved up to where the previous tasks were located.

## 3. Additional Considerations

After making this project, I could develop a better interface that is more pleasing to look at and I could add more features that users could use to help label the importance of tasks. I could also create a calender system that could show what tasks are due on certain days based on the users input.
