Budget Calculator
===============

-   **Class: System Analysis and Software Design** 
-   **Grade:90** 
-   **Language(s): C++** 
-   **Source Code Repository:none**

## Project description

It calculates the overall income a person makes within five weeks.

## How to run the program

The project can be runned by downloading it into any program that can run c++. In my project I used the "run" button in Visual Studio Code.

## UI Design

The user will submit how much money they make each hour and how many hours a week they worked. It will then calculate how much money is made after taxes.

## 3. Additional Considerations

After making this project, I could add a system that can detect if integers are being submitted and if a string or nothing is submitted an error will occur. I could also make it to where it could calulate the budget needed for a whole year after taxes. The overall code can be made into a work in progress if given the proper time.
