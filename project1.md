## Project description

It calculates the overall income a person makes within five weeks.

## How to run the program

The project can be runned by downloading it into any program that can run c++. In my project I used the "run" button in Visual Studio Code.

## UI Design

The user will submit how much money they make each hour and how many hours a week they worked. It will then calculate how much money is made after taxes.
