## Project description

The user can select four options of what they want to buy. After selecting the items and pressing submit, they will go to another page that will show them the total of their selection.

## How to run the program

The project can be runned by downloading it into any program that can run php. I used Visual studio code for the project and to run it I connected it to the php server and would run it there.

## UI Design

The user will choose options given to them. When clicking the submit button they will be taken to another page that will show the total of their selection and it will be put into a table for them to view.
