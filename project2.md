Tax Calculator

## Project description

The project code takes input from the user for the amount of money they earned and their tax rate. It then calculates the tax amount.

## How to run the program

The project can be runned by downloading it into any program that can run php. I used Visual studio code for the project and to run it I connected it to the php server and would run it there.

## UI Design

When runned it shows the two bars to submit content. Then when number values are submitted it will then return values of what was submitted. If values input are not integers then it will go to an error screen.

## 3. Additional Considerations

Additional considerations could be that I could make the calculator show the tax amount for months and a chart to show the difference in amount over time.
